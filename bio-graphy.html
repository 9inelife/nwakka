							<h3 class="name">About Emma Nwaka</h3>
							<p>
                                                           Born into a simple family in a quiet village in Amokwe-Amiyi,
								Ogudasa in Isuikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State, Emma Nwaka has always believed that one’s life’s trajectory is
								shaped by the mind, strong will and a grounded belief in God.</p>
							<P>One could say that Emma Nwaka is no stranger to opposition and life’s challenges. As a young man, one of the first walls of resistance that he had to scale was access to education. One of his favourite stories to tell is when he was offered admission to read Law at the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The admission came when he had just started studying journalism and after successfully passing JAMB of which he was one of the first sets in 1978. With zero money in his pocket and the lack of financial support from his parents, Emma recalls going to meet with the university registrar to plead for a partial refund of his journalism fees to enable him to proceed to study Law at the University of Nigeria. The Registrar told him point blank that fees are non-refundable. Young Emma Nwaka broke down in tears and Mr. Ajayi, the registrar, had pity on him and gave him some money.
								It was about 30 years later that Senator Nwaka found out that Mr. Ajayi had actually refunded him out of his own personal funds. </p>
							<p>Emma has carried this grit, mental fortitude and belief in the benevolence of society through law school, to becoming the first selected State Legal Advisor in the National Republican Convention under old Imo State, to being one of the youngest members of the Senate at 34, to joining the People’s Democratic Party where he has served under various capacities as a 
								State commissioner and Party Chairman and to seating on the boards of both private and public institutions. </p>
							<p>His life experiences have taught him to look into the eyes of every young Nigerian and see value and potential; the same way Mr.
								Ajayi looked at him. The wisdom and knowledge he has attained in his journey of life makes him look up in gratitude to the older generation who believed in him and gave him a ladder to climb. He desires to ensure that 
								as Governor of Abia, all spheres of society in Abia, the young and old, will be given the opportunity achieve their greatest heights by improving education, strengthening governance, boosting commerce & trade, reinforcing security and imbibing patriotism in the hearts of the young and old. </p>
							<p>Emma Nwaka’s desire to become the next Governor of Abia State is not born out of ambition.
								It is an opportunity to roll up his sleeve to serve, work and rebuild God’s Own State of Abia.</P>
						<p>Today, you will still find Emma spending his quiet times sitting on his favourite chair reading a book. 
							His current read is an old favourite - Beware Soul Brother by Chinua Achebe.</p>

											<p>His parents, Late Mr. and Mrs. Godwill Ezurike Nwaka resided in Amokwe-Amiyi,
												Oguduasa in Isuikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State. He started his primary
												school education at Municipal Council School, Orogbum in Port Harcourt. His family relocated to their  village at  the  start
												of  the Nigerian  civil war. Like other children of school age within the Biafran enclave, he lost a couple of schooling years on account
												of the civil hostilities. He recommenced his primary education at the Local Authority Primary School, Amokwe-Amiyi and concluded same at Methodist 
												Primary School, Emene in Enugu State in 1972.</p>

											<p>In 1973, young Emma Nwaka gained admission at St. Theresa's Secondary School, Nsukka. His parents couldnot send him there because they
												did not have the financial resources to maintain him in the boarding house. The option which he took was to proceed to Boys' High School, 
												lsuikwuato which he attended as a day student from his maternal uncle's house. Emma Nwaka still recalls the drudgery of having to trek up and down 
												the hill every school day. It was only in his senior years that he became a boarder.
												He passed the West African School Certificate Examination in 1977 by which time his parents had relocated to Lagos.
											There is one incident that still brings tears to Emma Nwaka's eyes. That was the time his parents could not afford to send him and his elder sister back to school after vacation. </p>

											<h5>Law School</h5>
											<p>He started his university journey by studying journalism by correspondence until he gained admission at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ) then at Breadfruit Street, Lagos Island. He was able to support his education by working 
												as a key boy by one of the companies that handled the construction of Festac Town, Lagos and as the school was non-residential, he recalls leaving his Ajegunle home very early in the morning hopping from one bus to another every school day. His heart wasn’t in journalism,
												he wanted to be a lawyer and he firmly believed a university degree was integral to the better life he desired for his life and family. Emma was among the first set that sat for JAMB exams in 1978. He did well in the exams and was offered admission to read Law at the prestigious University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Again, the money problem reared its ugly head,
												Emma Nwaka remembers pleading in tears with the Registrar at NIJ for a partial refund
												to enable him pay his fees at University of Nsukka. 
												Which out of benevolence was granted to him.
                                                                                                Emma Nwaka concluded his legal studies in 1982 and was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1983 as a Solicitor and Advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. 
												After his national youth service at the Ministry of Justice, 
												Kano, Emma Nwaka joined the Law Firm of the Late Chief James Uba in Aba in 1984.</P>

										<div class="bpitem-content">
											<p>After his national youth service at the Ministry of Justice, Kano, Emma Nwaka joined the Law Firm of the Late Chief James Uba in Aba in 1984. In 1987, he went solo under the rubric of Okaome Law Firm.
												Okaome simply means one whose word is his bond. 
												And any person who has had any dealings with Emma Nwaka will attest that his life embodies this name.
                                                                                                When the Nigerian Military President, General Babangida sounded the clarion call for the new breed to show interest in politics, Emma Nwaka took the bait.
												He joined the National Republican Convention and became the first elected St at e Legal Adviser of the party in the old Imo State. When Abia was carved out of the Imo St at e in 1991, Emma Nwaka disengaged as Legal Adviser and successfully ran for the Senate where he became at 34 years of age one of the youngest members of the red chamber. His senate years were cut short by General Abacha' s coup of 1993. Following this, Emma Nwaka returned to his law chamber.
